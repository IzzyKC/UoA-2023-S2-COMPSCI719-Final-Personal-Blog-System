Our webapp, Philantropic Polar Bears -- A Blog is a fully functional stack with front end, back end and database functionality. Users are able to create accounts for for access to the full suite of functionality. Or alternatively, a user without a registered account can still access it, but with some limited functionality. We decided not to go with a themed blog, as this gives users the ability to create their own theme in line with the content they publish. Users are able to read, write, publish and favourite articles as they like with the ability to upload additional documents.
